                <h2>Balance</h2>
                <p>1. Balance is about keeping different parts of your life like: work, school, relationships, or lifting, in harmony with each other so that none of them completely overhwelm the others.</p>
                <p>2. This value was developed by experiencing life without balance. For me, focusing too much on the gym or relationships has drawn me away from school which is the most important in the present time. Or putting to much effort and time into school that I have no social life and feel depressed when I have nothing to do.</p>
                <p>3. Balance is important to me because it helps keep my life stable and fulfilled. It allows me to be productive in aspects of my life without losing sight of my health, happiness, or important connections with other people.</p>
                <p>4. Without Balance, someone can get burned out, stressed, or negelect areas of their life that may be imporant. For example, focusing only on work and school could damage relationships or mental health.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Integrity</h2>
                <p>1. Integrity is about being honest and staying true to what you believe and value even when it is hard or when nobody is watching.</p>
                <p>2. Personally it came from a role model. My Father, he always emphasized honesty and accountability and wanted me to apply that into my life. </p>
                <p>3. This is important because it gives me credibility and respect. It helps me build stronger relationships and helps others know that they are able to rely on me because I will do what needs to be done.</p>
                <p>4. Without Integrity, trust breaks down. Friends, family, or coworkers lose faith in you and what you are capable of doing. This can also lead to feeling guilt and being disappointed in yourself.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Responsibility</h2>
                <p>1. Responsibility menas taking ownership of your actions, duties, and commitments in life. It is being able to follow through on something and being dependable.</p>
                <p>2. I have developed this throughout my childhood. Through doing chores, havinf deadlines for homeowork or projects, and even watching over my siblings. This helped lead me to understand that being responsible leads to greater independence and trust from others.</p>
                <p>3. This is important to me because it allows me to be reliable and trustworthy to others. It ensures me that goals wil be met and relationships will stay strong.</p>
                <p>4. Not having Responsibility allows the risk of letting people down, missing opportunities, or facing negative consequences like: failing a test, fired from a job, or damaging trust.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Respect</h2>
                <p>1. Respect means treating others the way you'd want to be treated by listening, valuing differences, and recognizing the worth of people and their ideas.</p>
                <p>2. I developed respect from my parents. They taught me growing up to be kind and respectful especially to adults. This helped me develop good manners and to listen and respond kindly.</p>
                <p>3. This is very important because it builds positive relationships and communities. It also helps keep the world a good place when there is someone who wants to be kind and respectful to others no matter what.</p>
                <p>4. Without respect, relationships become strained. Disrespect leads to conflict, resentment, or isolation.</p>
