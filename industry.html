    <h2> Business Role</h2>
    <p> My business role in our indtusty is the IT guy but, more specifically Networking. I am responsible for setting up and maintaining the organization's network systems.

    <h2> Ethical Issue</h2>
    <p> An ethical issue that could arise is handling sensitive or confidential information. For example, we could recieve classified documents or private sources' identities. As a networking professional, I must ensure that data isn't leaked or accessed by unauthorized people. I have to make sure that privacy and security is protected by both employees and information sources. </p>

    <h2>Cybersecurity Issues </h2>
    <h4>Two possible Cybersecurity issues are Phishing and Email Attacks and Data Breaches.</h4>
        <p>1. When it comes to Phishing and Email Attacks, reporters and editors often receice thousands of emails a day. Some of those could be fake messages that are designed to steal your information, login credentials, or install malware on company computers. These threats are tuff to spot, which means you need to be careful with clicking unknown links or documents.</p>
        <p>2. Data Breaches could be hackers trying to break into a company's network to access unpublished stories, reporter communications, or subscriber data. A weak firewall or outdated software leaves companies vulnerable and can lead to a long line of issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices </h2>
    <h4>It is always a good idea to have Cybersecurity practices set up in companies or offices. This will make your life in the long run much better, especially if you are able to dodge potential threats. Here are five Best Practices to ensure security.</h4>
        <p>1. Multi-Factor Authentication- This requires multiple verificaion steps to allow access to accounts.</p>
        <p>2. Encrypting Data- This ensures that sensitive data or information is protected when stored or sent.</p>
        <p>3. Regular Software Updates- This keeps all systems and antivirus programs current to patch vulnerablilties. Which hackers know all about.</p>
        <p>4. Employee Training- Teaching staff how to recognize phishing emails or suspicious links will help eliminate possible data breaches or viruses being installed.</p>
        <p>5. Strong Firewalls and VPNs- This will protect the internal netowkr and secure remote connections to field reporters.</p>
